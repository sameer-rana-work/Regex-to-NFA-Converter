# Regex-to-NFA-Converter

A React-based web application that converts regular expressions to Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) using Thompson's construction algorithm.

## Description
This project is a compiler design tool that takes a regular expression as input, converts it to postfix notation, and generates an NFA. It includes features to:
- Validate regular expressions
- Display the postfix expression and NFA transitions
- Visualize the NFA as a diagram using Viz.js
- Simulate input strings on the NFA
- Run a test suite for multiple strings
- Save and load NFA data

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
